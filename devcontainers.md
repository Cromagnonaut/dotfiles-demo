# What are Dev Containers and and what are the benefits of using them?

In short, [Devlopment Containers](https://containers.dev/overview) allows for creating a full development environment that in a portable environment that is seperated from the host. This can be be seen as a pre-stage to the more known production container, that is used to deploy a compiled application.

## Which problems are solved?

Developing software or admistering systems often require a specific environment / runtime taht varies for each specific application. Instead of creating this envirnoment on the host, dependencies and settings are created in a closed-off container. Another benefit is portability. Due to is containerized nature, the full environment is portable and cann for example be moved to a different machine or user.

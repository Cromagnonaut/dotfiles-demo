# Mischa van den Burg's dev-container course

This is course 

## What do I want to achieve by taking this course?

Creating a basic workflow for protable config environments and removing clutter. The goal is to have a "stateless" workstation.

## Roadmap

Starting with basic tools reduces the risk of overwhelm, which I faced before.

1. Learning basic config-management with bash and vim, using this for a few month's:
  1. File-Management (learning the filesystem)
  2. Text editing from the command-line (enables managing linux systems)
  3. UNIX philosophy - Doing tasks the UNIX way to be more efficient
  4. STDIN, STDOUT (I need to learn this)
  5. Applying UNIX filters, pipes and redirection
2. Moving to zsh and neovim

I will follow the course by doing the partial approach by taking the first modules (Dev Containers through Mise) and after some usage, I will take the advanced courses with zsh and Neovim.
